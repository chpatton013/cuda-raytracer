Parallelizing this code was sooooo hard! We had to take our function that
iterates over pixels and get rid of the for loops! Looking back, we basically
followed Nick's advice without knowing it.
We had a bunch of issues with C++ incompatiblity, so we rewrote the code using
structs with no member functions, and this fixed all of problems. The only
difference between the CPU and GPU code is an intermediate fucntion that
initializes the CUDA data and fires off the kernel.
